Peace, love and taco grease!

I don’t know if it’s fair to call their Russian dressing Russian dressing — it should be called something sexy, like liquid Moscow.

They make a porchetta that you won’t forgetta.

If it tastes really good and it’s funky, it’s funkalicious.

That deep fryer looks like the community pool in Flavourtown.

That’s the definition of stupid in Flavourtown. Stupid in a good way.

Splash some rub around the rest of the hog for good measure. This really doesn’t do a dang thing, but it makes you feel good about things and makes for good drama.

I’ve always been an eccentric, a rocker at heart. I can’t play the guitar, but I can play the griddle.

My seafood is so fresh it’ll slap ya!

You know what they say, the bigger the trash can, the more nachos you can make!
